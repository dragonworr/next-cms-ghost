# Contributors welcome!

As the interest in this project rises, I want to give you some guidelines how you can best contribute to this project.

#### **Did you find a bug?**

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/styxlab/next-cms-ghost/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/styxlab/next-cms-ghost/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- Please propose your change in [Github Discussions](https://github.com/styxlab/next-cms-ghost/discussions) before you start writing code.

- Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

- Ask any question about how to use next-cms-ghost in the [Github Discussions](https://github.com/styxlab/next-cms-ghost/discussions).

If you have any idea or concern that you do not want to dicuss publicly, just [send me a private message on twitter](https://twitter.com/JamifyJS).

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
